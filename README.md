# magicmime

`magicmime` is a Go package which allows you to discover a file's mimetype by looking for magic numbers in its content. It could be used as a supplementary for Go's [`mime`](http://golang.org/pkg/mime/) package which only interprets the file extension to detect mimetypes. Internally, it implements [libmagic(3)](http://linux.die.net/man/3/libmagic) bindings.

Tested on Linux and Mac OS X, should be working on BSD. You could be able to build and make it working with Cygwin on Windows.

## Usage
In order to start, go get this repository:
~~~ go
go get github.com/rakyll/magicmime
~~~
You may need to install devel packages for `libmagic`. On Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS, get `libmagic-dev` package from your package manager. On Mac OS X get `libmagic` via Homebrew: `brew install libmagic`. If you don't have the required dev packages, compilation will be terminated by an error saying `magic.h` cannot be found.

~~~ go
import "github.com/rakyll/magicmime"
mimetype, err := magicmime.TypeByFile("/path/to/file")
~~~

Available functions are:

~~~ go
func TypeByFile(filePath string) (string, error)
func TypeByBuffer(buffer []byte) (string, error)
~~~
