# magicmime [![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/rakyll/magicmime/master.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/rakyll/magicmime) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/rakyll/magicmime/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/rakyll/magicmime) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/rakyll/magicmime?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/rakyll/magicmime)

`magicmime` is a Go package which allows you to discover a file's mimetype by looking for magic numbers in its content. It could be used as a supplementary for Go's [`mime`](http://golang.org/pkg/mime/) package which only interprets the file extension to detect mimetypes. Internally, it implements [libmagic(3)](http://linux.die.net/man/3/libmagic) bindings.

Tested on Linux and Mac OS X, should be working on BSD. You could be able to build and make it working with Cygwin on Windows.

## Prerequisites
This uses the `libmagic` library from the `file` tool, so you might need to install the development package for `libmagic`. On Debian or Ubuntu: `apt-get install libmagic-dev`. On RHEL, CentOS or Fedora: `yum install file-devel`. On Mac OS X: `brew install libmagic`. If you don't have the required package, compilation will be terminated by an error saying `magic.h` cannot be found.


## Usage
In order to start, go get this repository:

``` sh
